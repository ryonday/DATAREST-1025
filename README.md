# Example Project for DATAREST-1025 #

[Issue link](https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAREST-1025)

## How to Run ##

The git repository includes three different tags:

* The boot-1.5.2 tag builds off of Spring Boot 1.5.2
* The boot-1.4.5 tag builds off of Spring Boot 1.4.5
* The boot-1.3.8 tag builds off of Spring Boot 1.3.8

The issue in question affects the Spring-Data releasetrains
used in Spring Boot 1.4.x and 1.5.x; 1.3.x is unaffected.
